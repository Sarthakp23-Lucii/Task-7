## Task-7: Basic Sales Summary with SQLite and Python

# Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **SQLite** in Python to summarize sales data and visualize revenue per product.

# What I Did
- Created a **SQLite database** (`sales_data.db`) with a `sales` table.  
- Loaded sales data from a **CSV file** into the database.  
- Ran a **SQL query** to calculate total quantity sold and total revenue per product.  
- Displayed the results using **Pandas**.  
- Created a **bar chart** of revenue by product using **Matplotlib**.  

# How to Run
1. Ensure `sales_data.csv` is in the project folder.  
2. Run the Python script:
```bash
python Sales_Data.py
